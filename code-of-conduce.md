## Communication

* Question/Discussion

How to proceed 
For simple questions or discussions, I propose that we use telegram or the slack channel (https://microservicesplatform.slack.com/). For points which requires that we comment, add it maybe to a sprint/milestone, I prefer that we open a github issue : https://github.com/obsidian-toaster/platform
