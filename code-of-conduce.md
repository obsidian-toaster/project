# Code of conduce

## Communication

This section will detail how to proceed to communicate between the members of the project concerning the topics which are highlighted hereafter:

* Question/Ping

For simple process where you would like to contact a project's member, question it, please use the slack IRC team (https://microservicesplatform.slack.com/) and its corresponding channel.
If, by example, you would like to ask a question about the "Generator", then you can use the #generator channel.

* Discussion

When a point, which have been started as a question, will require that:

- Multiple participants are involved to provide their advise in order to answer to the question or
- Somebody investigates and makes some research

then it makes more sense in this case to open a ticket on the github project : https://github.com/obsidian-toaster/platform

As the discussion could become an idea, a new user story or a task to be implemented, acting as such will allow to keep track of the request, assign it to a resource, manage the 
code changed using a Pull Request and finally adding the change to a milestone and sprint.

* Announce

The Obsidian engineers Mailing List should be used to communicate the agenda, minutes of the bi-weekly meeting, to publish general announces or changes but never to start a discussion
. This channel could also be used to prepare the sprint or communicate the project milestones. 

When an email about a meeting is published on the Obsidian Mailing List and that you want to participate or to invite somebody, please use this procedure :
@AI: I would like to ask you to nominate yourself for the call and forward this email to anyone you know should be aware. We will invite them and add them to the obsidian-pm-list as well.
